                        This website presents a concise overview of an exploratory data analysis of Steam game releases
                        from 2021 to 2025. The analysis focuses on pricing patterns, publication frequency, genre
                        composition, play modes, and player recommendations in order to identify structural trends
                        within the contemporary PC game market.

                    <h2>Pricing Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        The majority of games released on Steam during this period are priced below €10, resulting in
                        a low average price for paid titles. While the average price of games peaks around 2023, the
                        limited timeframe and potential external influences mean that no strong long-term pricing
                        trend can be reliably inferred from this data alone.

                                Most paid releases fall below €10, with sharply declining counts in higher price bands.
                                Outliers above €50 exist but represent only a small fraction of the overall catalog.

                                cautiously rather than as a definitive trend.

                        The number of games released on Steam increases steadily from 2021 to 2025, indicating a clear
                        upward trend in publication frequency. Within individual years, releases are relatively evenly
                        distributed but show noticeable peaks in autumn months.

                        Single-player games make up the majority of Steam releases across all observed years.
                        Multiplayer titles are less common but increase steadily over time, indicating growth in

                        <li>
                            <strong>Temporal scope:</strong> The dataset covers releases from 2021–2025 only, limiting
                            insight into longer-term historical trends.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Popularity proxy:</strong> Recommendation counts are used as an indicator of
                            popularity, but do not directly measure revenue, sales volume, or long-term engagement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>External influences:</strong> Economic conditions, platform policies, marketing
                            efforts, and post-release updates may affect outcomes independently of price or genre.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Catalog coverage:</strong> Only titles present in the dataset are analyzed;
                            delisted, region-restricted, or missing entries are not represented.
