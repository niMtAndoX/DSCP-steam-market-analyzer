                    <p class="intro">
                        This overview summarizes an exploratory data analysis of thousands of recent Steam releases,
                        focusing on pricing, release timing, genres, and play modes. Steam is a uniquely rich platform:
                        it combines AAA blockbusters with a long tail of independent experiments, making it ideal for
                        studying how modern PC games are produced, priced, and discovered.

                    <h2>Pricing Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        Most games are priced under €10, with a dense cluster of low-cost and free-to-play titles.
                        Average prices appear to peak around 2023 before softening slightly, but sampling and
                        catalog changes make this trend approximate rather than definitive. Price signals on Steam
                        must therefore be interpreted cautiously alongside genre, visibility, and discount behavior.

                                Most paid releases fall below €10, with sharply declining counts in higher price bands.
                                Outliers above €50 exist but represent a small fraction of the catalog.

                                Average prices peak around 2023, then flatten or slightly decline. This might reflect
                                increased competition from low-priced indie games rather than a structural drop in
                                production costs or perceived value.

                    <p>
                        Steam shows strong growth in annual release counts, consistent with low digital distribution
                        barriers and accessible development tooling. Within each year, releases cluster around
                        autumn months, when publishers target holiday demand and platform traffic is typically higher.

                                The number of titles released each year increases over the 2021–2025 window, with
                                especially strong growth in the later years as more small studios and solo developers
                                reach the platform.

                                Releases are not evenly distributed across the year: autumn months (September–November)
                                are clear peaks, while early-year months are quieter. This aligns with common release
                                strategies around sales events and holiday spending.

                    <p>
                        Single-player experiences dominate recent Steam releases, reflecting the lower coordination
                        and infrastructure costs for small teams. Multiplayer support, however, grows steadily over
                        time, particularly among competitive and co‑operative titles that depend on network effects.

                            Single-player support appears in the majority of titles for every year, but multiplayer
                            features trend upward, suggesting a gradual shift toward social and live-service designs.

                    <p>
                        Genre tags reveal a dense core of highly connected categories—especially Indie, Action, and
                        Adventure—that frequently co‑occur in the same titles. More specialized genres sit on the
                        periphery of this landscape, forming smaller, more isolated clusters of niche experiences.

                            while outer clusters capture narrower tastes such as specific sports or experimental tags.

                        Using community recommendations as a rough proxy for popularity, both high-budget franchises
                        and lean indie productions can achieve strong player engagement. Recommendation counts capture

                            can put smaller games alongside major studio productions.

                        These findings summarize patterns in a recent slice of the Steam catalog and should be read
                        as descriptive rather than predictive. Several structural limitations are worth noting:

                    <h3>Key Caveats</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Temporal scope:</strong> The dataset is restricted to releases from 2021–2025, so
                            long‑term historical trends and pre‑2021 baselines are not visible.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Signal vs. outcome:</strong> Recommendation counts are treated as a popularity proxy,
                            but they do not directly represent units sold, revenue, or playtime.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>External influences:</strong> Macroeconomic factors, platform policy changes,
                            marketing budgets, and major content updates can all shift outcomes independently of
                            genre or price.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Catalog bias:</strong> The analysis focuses on titles present in the curated dataset;
                            unlisted, delisted, or region‑locked games are implicitly excluded.
                        </li>
